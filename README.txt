A redesign of strava, the popular platform for uploading gps segments of your runs or biking trips.  They have been slowly taking away funcionality from the free version , which makes the app less enjoyable to use.  The platform also get criticism for inadvertently creating a intimidating environment for people new to the sport.  This version will be less about the numbers and more about just getting out there and running!
